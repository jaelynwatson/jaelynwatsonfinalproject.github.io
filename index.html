<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e always hear students saying that their college experience is overwhelming. But do we know how much of that stress is caused by the schoolwork assigned to the students or does stress come from students being involved in extracurricular. As a college student myself, I know the forms of pressure that college students face. One of the stressors that college students face is financial. According to the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2017-01-11/weigh-whether-to-work-during-college">U.S. Census Bureau</a>, 72 percent of undergraduate students have to work, and one-fifth of those students work full-time jobs.
</p>
<br>
<p>“In a perfect world, college students SHOULD NOT work a job while going to school,” said Terae Lynch, a senior from Towson University.
</p>
<br>
<p>Most college students choose to work while in school because they are responsible for paying their college tuition. Some students have to pay for their housing while away at school and some students like myself, choose to work so that they will not be a burden to their parents. The cost of college is extremely expenses. Students and their families rely on financial aid to pay the tuition bill. Getting a part-time job allows students to have pocket money.</p>

<h1>So, is it schoolwork or is it working a job that causes stress?</h1>

<p>There is no one right or wrong answer to this question. However, working while going to school can cause distraction in a student’s ability to complete assignments. If a student falls behind in schoolwork because of their job, this leads one to become stressed.</p>

<p>Dr. Sugiarti A. Musabiq from the University of Indonesia conducted a study to assess stressors in the daily life of college students.Dr. Musabiq found that the second source of stress among college students is their academics. There were 67 students included in this study. Of those 67, 48.7% say that academic stress is caused by the number of assignments given during the first week of the academic semester.</p>

<p>“I would say that about 70% of my stress comes from schoolwork because that is all there really is to worry about at this point in life,” said Ebele Nwogbo, a senior at the University of Maryland, College Park.</p>

<p>Schoolwork can also be the cause of stress because getting good grades can help a student obtain internship or job opportunities. For Example, The National Institutes of Health requires students to submit a transcript when applying for a job or a fellowship.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>
Are there multiple factors that cause stress amongst college students?
</h2>
<p>The answer is YES! Of the 67 students that were surveyed, 32% of the students said that majority of their stress comes from academic work.</p>

		<p>University of Maryland senior Tanesha Brockington said, “I think that going to college has caused me to develop some kind of stress and anxiety. College is literally the process of preparing myself for what I am going be doing in my adulthood and that is a lot to think about.”</p>

<br>
<p>It would be unfair to say that schoolwork is the sole reason that college students develop stress, anxiety or depression. I think it would be easy to argue that schoolwork and extracurricular activities like working can add to stress.</p>
